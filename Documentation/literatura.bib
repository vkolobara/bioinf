However, its current error rates are estimated in the range of 15–40{\%}, significantly higher than those of the prevalent next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (less than 1{\%}). Fundamental bioinformatics tasks such as {\textless}italic{\textgreater}de novo{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} genome assembly and variant calling require high-quality sequences that need to be extracted from these long but erroneous 3GS sequences. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
